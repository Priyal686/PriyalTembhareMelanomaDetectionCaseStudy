##Skin Cancer detection(Melonoma) - CNN model Assignment
The solution is divided into the following sections:

Data understanding and exploration
Data preparation
Model building- CNN network with minimal neural network models
Different optimizers and fine tuning of  CNN network efficiency
Visualization of distrbution of samples in each class
Observation and inference
It is observed that accuracy of model with basic CNN is less We then added dropouts and normalization to finetune model Additionally corrected imbalance in distribution of samples across different classes and hence finetuning models Usage of different optimizers, Augmentation of model

Final inference: After rebalancing the classes, there is great improvement in validation data accuracy. The model is more general and not overfitting/underfitting.
